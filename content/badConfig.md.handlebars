### Bad or no Config found
I require that you have a {{ configFilePath }} configuration file in order for me to work my magic.

You are getting this message because:
- A: I couldn't find the file at {{ configFilePath }}
- B: It's invalid JSON
- C: It didn't validate correctly (in this case run `{{ botCommand }} configuration` to learn more)
